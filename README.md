# One CLI to rule them all

## Codemotion Workshop Fest 2023

>*One CLI to rule them all,
One CLI to find them,
One CLI to bring them all and in the cluster deploy them.*

## Step 1

Good job! We initialized the Cobra CLI, Viper, and wrote our `init` command. Let's proceed with this warm-up!

### What are we going to do in this step?

- Implement the `add-context` command, which will add new K8s contexts to our Viper config file

If you get lost in the process, don't worry! You can still checkout to the next step and resume from there!

Enjoy!
