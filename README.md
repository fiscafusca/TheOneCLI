# One CLI to rule them all (Codemotion Workshop Fest 2023)

>*One CLI to rule them all,
One CLI to find them,
One CLI to bring them all and in the cluster deploy them.*

Welcome, fellow travelers! If you're here, chances are you're embarking on a journey to forge **The One CLI**. 

As Gandalf once said, *"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us"*. So let's get started on this epic adventure!

## ⚠️ Spoiler Alert ⚠️

This branch contains the final version of The One CLI! If you want to follow along with the workshop and build the CLI step-by-step, make sure to start from the `step-0` branch.

## Getting Started

To get started with The One CLI, you'll need:

- Go (stable)
- `kubectl`
- `git`
- kind (for testing)

## Building the One CLI

Throughout this workshop, we'll be building The One CLI together, one step at a time. Each step will add new features and functionalities to the CLI, until we have a simple, functioning tool for interacting with Kubernetes.

To get started, clone the repository and checkout to `step-0`!

### Steps

Impatient to know what we are going to implement? Here's a sneak peek for you:

- **Step 0:** Cobra initialization, `init` command
- **Step 1:** `add-context` command
- **Step 2:** read YAML manifest and create K8s resources
- **Step 3:** `deploy` command
- **Step 4:** multi-cluster deployment
