# One CLI to rule them all

## Codemotion Workshop Fest 2023

>*One CLI to rule them all,
One CLI to find them,
One CLI to bring them all and in the cluster deploy them.*

## Step 2

You came a long way! We have our CLI, we have our K8s resources... Time to **DEPLOY**!

### What are we going to do in this step?

- Write some useful helper functions to **get**, **create**, and **patch** resources on the cluster
- Write a function that **deploys** the resources in a given **context**
- Implement the `deploy` Cobra command

If you get lost in the process, don't worry! You can still checkout to the next step and resume from there!

Enjoy!
