# One CLI to rule them all

## Codemotion Workshop Fest 2023

>*One CLI to rule them all,
One CLI to find them,
One CLI to bring them all and in the cluster deploy them.*

## Step 0

Welcome to the very beginning of this workshop! If you're reading this, you probably decided to follow along and build The One CLI together. Awesome!

### What are we going to do in this step?

- Initialize the **Cobra CLI**
- Initialize **Viper** for the configuration file
- Write our very first command: `init`!

If you get lost in the process, don't worry! You can still checkout to the next step and resume from there!

Enjoy!
