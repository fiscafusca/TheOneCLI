# One CLI to rule them all

## Codemotion Workshop Fest 2023

>*One CLI to rule them all,
One CLI to find them,
One CLI to bring them all and in the cluster deploy them.*

## Step 2

We're almost done! One last step, to make this CLI even mightier! How does some *multi-cluster deployment* sound?

### What are we going to do in this step?

- Enhance the `deploy` command to support deploy of multiple contexts (specified in the config file)

If you get lost in the process, don't worry! You can checkout to the main branch and test the final version out!

Enjoy!
